      \begin{block}{Argumentation}
        Assume that a task has two independent parts, A and B. B takes
        roughly 25\% of the time of the whole computation. By working
        very hard, one may be able to make this part 5 times faster,
        but this only reduces the time for the whole computation by a
        little. In contrast, one may need to perform less work to make
        part A be twice as fast. This will make the computation much
        faster than by optimizing part B, even though B's speed-up is
        greater by ratio, (5x versus 2x)
